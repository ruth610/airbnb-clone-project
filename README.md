  role — Defines user type (guest, host, or admin).

Relationships:

  A user can list multiple properties.
  
  A user can make multiple bookings.
  
  A user can leave multiple reviews.

2. Properties

Key Fields:

  id — Unique property identifier.
  
  title — Property name or title.
  
  description — Detailed property description.
  
  price_per_night — Cost of booking per night.
  
  location — Property location details.

Relationships:

  A property belongs to one user (the host).
  
  A property can have many bookings.
  
  A property can have many reviews.

3. Bookings

Key Fields:

  id — Unique booking identifier.
  
  user_id — References the user who made the booking.
  
  property_id — References the booked property.
  
  check_in_date — Booking start date.
  
  check_out_date — Booking end date.

Relationships:

  A booking belongs to one user and one property.
  
  A booking can have one payment.

4. Payments

Key Fields:

  id — Unique payment identifier.
  
  booking_id — References the related booking.
  
  amount — Payment amount.
  
  status — Indicates payment state (pending, completed, failed).
  
  transaction_date — Date and time of the transaction.

Relationships:

**✨ Feature Breakdown**

1. User Management

  This feature enables users to register, authenticate, and manage their profiles securely. It supports role-based access control, ensuring hosts and guests have the right permissions. Passwords are encrypted, and authentication tokens are used for secure session handling.

2. Property Management

  Hosts can create, update, and delete property listings, including details such as title, description, price, and location. This feature ensures properties are displayed dynamically, allowing users to explore available accommodations easily.

3. Booking System

  The booking module allows users to reserve properties and manage their booking details such as check-in and check-out dates. It handles availability checks and ensures that overlapping bookings are prevented.

4. Payment Processing

  This feature integrates a secure payment gateway for handling transactions related to property bookings. It manages transaction states (pending, completed, failed) and records detailed payment information for accountability.

5. Review System

  Users can submit reviews and ratings for properties they’ve stayed in, providing valuable feedback to hosts and insights for other users. Reviews help maintain trust and improve property quality on the platform.

6. Data Optimization

  Database indexing and caching strategies (via Redis) are used to improve query performance and reduce server load. This ensures the system remains fast, scalable, and responsive even as data volume increases.


🔒 API Security

  Ensuring robust API security is essential to protect sensitive user information, maintain data integrity, and prevent unauthorized access to system resources. The following security measures are implemented across the backend services:

1. Authentication

  All endpoints are protected using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to verify user identity before granting access. This ensures that only registered and authenticated users can interact with protected routes.
  ➡️ Why it matters: Prevents unauthorized access to user data, bookings, and property details.

2. Authorization

  Role-based access control (RBAC) ensures that users have permissions only for actions they are allowed to perform. For instance, only hosts can manage property listings, and only admins can perform administrative tasks.
  ➡️ Why it matters: Protects against privilege escalation and ensures clear separation of user roles.

3. Rate Limiting

  Rate limiting is applied to restrict the number of API requests a user can make within a set time frame. This helps prevent abuse such as brute-force login attempts or denial-of-service attacks.
  ➡️ Why it matters: Preserves API performance and protects against malicious traffic spikes.

4. Data Encryption

  Sensitive information such as passwords and payment details is encrypted both in transit (via HTTPS) and at rest. This ensures data cannot be intercepted or tampered with.
  ➡️ Why it matters: Protects user credentials, payment data, and personal information from potential breaches.

5. Input Validation & Sanitization

  All incoming data is validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks such as SQL Injection or XSS.
  ➡️ Why it matters: Maintains data integrity and prevents attackers from exploiting backend vulnerabilities.

6. Secure Payment Processing

  Payment transactions are handled through secure, verified gateways that comply with industry standards (e.g., PCI-DSS).
  ➡️ Why it matters: Ensures that financial information remains confidential and trustworthy.


**  ⚙️ CI/CD Pipeline**

Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) pipelines automate the software development lifecycle — from code integration and testing to deployment. CI/CD ensures that every code change is automatically built, tested, and deployed, improving reliability and reducing manual effort.

Why CI/CD is Important

Consistency: Automates repetitive tasks to ensure consistent builds and deployments.

Faster Delivery: Reduces release time by automatically deploying updates after successful testing.

Early Bug Detection: Continuous testing helps identify and fix issues early in development.

Improved Collaboration: Encourages frequent commits and integration from multiple developers without conflicts.

Tools Used

GitHub Actions: Automates testing, building, and deployment workflows directly from the repository.

Docker: Containerizes the application for consistent environments across development, testing, and production.

Celery & Redis: Used for background task management and asynchronous operations within the pipeline.

PostgreSQL: Integrated into testing and deployment environments for data consistency checks.
